Data Visuallization
Matplotlib is a 2-D plotting library that helps in visualizing figures. Matplotlib emulates Matlab like 
graphs and visualizations. Matlab is not free, is difficult to scale and as a programming language is tedious.
So, matplotlib in Python is used as it is a robust, free and easy library for data visualization.
